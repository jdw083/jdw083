Hello All,

I have had this GitHub for a while and have decided to repurpose it for projects, learning, and showcasing what I have been working on.

Feel free to check it out.

The main repo is **jdw083/Portfolio**, which is what I am working on mainly, and is the main development area. The CodeCademy project was a repo from uni. 

Things you will see in jdw083:
  - PHP
  - Angular
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Javascript
  - JSON
  - Node
  - MySQL
  - etc.

Lastly, I will be showcasing my work in **jdw083/github.io**, which published at https://jdw083.github.io/. Feel very free to check it out or leave a comment here.
